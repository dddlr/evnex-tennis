Evnex project
=============

by [Grant Wong][github], 12-13 August 2021.

Tennis rules are new to me so I'm not sure if I got all of the intricacies
of tennis scoring, but hopefully this covers pretty much everything :)

Setup + how to test
-------------------

Tested on Node v15.12 on Linux.

```sh
~$ yarn
~$ yarn run test
```

Example usage
-------------

See `src/example.ts` for an example of how to create your own tennis matches.

This can be run by typing:

```sh
~$ yarn run build
~$ node dist/src/example.js
```
